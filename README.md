# AKKA LIBRARY USING SCALA !!!

## Day-1

* @ AKKA, What it is ? 
>A toolkit, integrate it without having to follow a source code layout. Akka helps us to focus on meeting business needs.  Akka provides Concurrency, Distribution, Fault tolerance out of the box Many programming models do not resolve the major problems associated with designing systems For modern computer architecture. Programming models must be fully distributed. Akka deals with many realities like Components get crashed without responding, messages get lost without a trace on the wire, and network latency fluctuates. So, Akka provides Multithreading, Transparent remote communication between systems and their components, A clustered, high-availability architecture that is elastic. It uses the actor model also gives you a vast set of tools that resolve the distributed/parallel system issues and provide everything where blends tightly and effectively together.


* @ Why modern systems need a new approach of programming?
* @ The Actor Model Meets New, Distributed Systems Needs. How ?

## Day-2

* @  Mechanism OF an ACTOR MODEL !!!
* @ Actor handling the error !!!

  * Remoting
  * Cluster
  * Cluster Sharding
  * Cluster Singleton
