# AKKA LIBRARY USING SCALA !!!

## Day-1

* **@ AKKA, What it is ?** 
>A toolkit, integrate it without having to follow a source code layout. Akka helps us to focus on meeting business needs.  Akka provides Concurrency, Distribution, Fault tolerance out of the box Many programming models do not resolve the major problems associated with designing systems For modern computer architecture. Programming models must be fully distributed. Akka deals with many realities like Components get crashed without responding, messages get lost without a trace on the wire, and network latency fluctuates. So, Akka provides Multithreading, Transparent remote communication between systems and their components, A clustered, high-availability architecture that is elastic. It uses the actor model also gives you a vast set of tools that resolve the distributed/parallel system issues and provide everything where blends tightly and effectively together.


* **@ Why modern systems need a new approach of programming?**
> Earlier, Many Organization developing  the distributed system with the day to day challenges which can not be completely tackle by conventional object-oriented programming(OOPs) that’s why Actor model came into the existence which was proposed by the Carl Hewitt. “A way to manage the parallel processing in a high-performance Network”. Actor model is the reality of modern multi-threaded, multi-CPU architectures.
Actor model focus on the main issues like:
a.	The  Encapsulation Challenge
b.	An  illusion of shared memory on modern computer architectures
c.	The Illusion of a Stack of Call


* **@ The Actor Model Meets New, Distributed Systems Needs. How ?**
 Many programming models or practices do not fulfill the need of the modern distributed System. The actor model focuses on communication, not just the exchange of code that occurs between the organization. The Actor model crux on the supreme points which allow the structure to act in a manner that better suits our model best.

Actor fundamental unit of computation that embodies:
	Processing
	Storage
	Communication


Advantage of Actor model 
as it allows to:
•	Enforce encapsulation without resorting to locks.
•	Use the cooperative entity model that responds to signals, changes state, and sends signals to each other to forward the entire application.
•	Stop worrying about an executing mechanism that is a mismatch to our world view.
